## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

```css - add a dot between a words
	.contract::after {
			content: '\2022';
```

```js - event delegation
const takeUserChoise = () => {
	const tools = document.querySelectorAll('.tools')
	tools.forEach(tool => {
		tool.addEventListener('click', e => {
			if (e.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
```

### Continued development

In future i wanna build this project using React and maybe Node.js to create a full-stack app
